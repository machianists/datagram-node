## What is Datagram
Servers used to be about running code and storing backups. Now they are about facilitating connections and serving data. Docker and Kubernetes have made it easy to spin up complex online services but we are still manually handling all the communication and data managing that happens between the users and the service.

Most of us share the experience of having spent too many hours configuring servers, setting up databases, figuring out a good way to save your data in the database, and then yet again writing a custom backend code to communicate with the user.

Datagram solves this by offering a framework to containerize "the server" and database.

You can run Datagram on any x86 or ARM based computer and it supports both client-server and peer-to-peer connection models out-of-the-box.

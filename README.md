![Datagram, the free data platform](media/header.png)
> Datagram is an open-source data platform that you can use to build secure shared databases and data structures with anyone. Datagram helps you to organize, share and download your data in a decentralized and peer-to-peer manner.

## 💡 The purpose why Datagram was created
Servers used to be about running code and storing backups. Now they are about facilitating connections and serving data. Docker and Kubernetes have made it easy to spin up complex server infrastructures. Despite advances in server orchestration we are still manually handling all the communication and data managing that happens between the users and the service.

Datagram is an easy-to-use library to build any sort of database or data structure on top of truly private and secure peer-to-peer internet.

## 🔌 The types of data can you send

- any type of file
- text and numbers
- lists
- spreadsheets
- streaming video and audio
- streaming binary

You can send as much data as you want in one datagram.

## 🔒 Everything encrypted from A to Z

Everything you send is automatically encrypted. Everything you receive is automatically verified. Everything from your data to internet connections Datagram makes is secured with the cryptographic best practices.

## 😆 Pricing

There is no pricing. Everything is free. This is peer-to-peer which means that your data goes directly to the receiver. If there's nobody in the middle, why would there be fees?

## 🎁 Get started

```bash
TO BE WRITTEN
```
## 🏎 Performance

Performance is good enough to power any modern consumer javascript application.
If you need to store, analyze and serve "big data", Datagram might not be your choice.

## 🔬 Running tests


```bash
# Install dependencies and test tooling
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# or run tests with debug logging
DEBUG=*datagram* npm test
```
